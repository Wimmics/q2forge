### SPARQL Query Generator/Executor

This is the third part of the Q²Forge pipeline. The user has the ability to generate a SPARQL query counterpart of a NL question, execute it against a KG, and get an interpretation of the results.
The question may originate from the preceding task, or the user may paste a question either hand-crafted or generated by another system.

Q²Forge relies on various strategies provided by [Gen²KGBot](https://github.com/Wimmics/gen2kgbot) to accomplish this task, which we refer to as *scenarios*. For more information about each scenario, please refer to the Gen²KGBot documentation.
