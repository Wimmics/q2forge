Generate a well-structured list of {number_of_questions} scientifically relevant questions based on the following knowledge graph by researchers:
- A brief description of the KG.
- A condensed schema representation of the KG.
- Some additional context to help generate questions.

Requirements:
1. Identify key subtopics and group questions accordingly.
2. Cover multiple scientific domains from the resource.
3. Include Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced levels of question complexity.
4. Provide examples of each complexity level.
5. Ensure clarity, precision, and thematic grouping.

Output:
- Clearly categorized and labeled questions by subtopic in the "question" key.
- Each question labeled with its complexity (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) and some tags in the "tags" key.

A brief description of the KG:
{brief_description}

A condensed schema representation of the KG.
{kg_schema}

Some additional context to help generate questions.
{additional_context}

Generate only {number_of_questions} questions. No more or less.

export const KG_DESCRIPTION = `IDSM ChemWebRDF Manual
The application is a part of the IDSM project and allows SPARQL querying of PubChem data.
Data Schema
The database uses the data coming from the PubChemRDF project that provides RDF formatted information available in the PubChem archive. It mainly comprises information from the PubChem Compound, Substance, and Bioassay databases.

The PubChemRDF data includes many semantic relationships, for which existing ontologies are employed, whenever it is possible. Parts of these ontologies (e.g., class hierarchies, resource labels) are loaded into the database as well. Summarization of the used ontologies and relationship predicates are summarized in the PubChemRDF documentation.`

PubChemRDF data is organized into different subdomains, including compound, substance, bioassay, gene/protein, pathway, taxonomy, cell line, reference, disease and more. Each individual subdomain can be accessed via the RESTful interface or downloaded on the FTP site and loaded into local triple stores.
