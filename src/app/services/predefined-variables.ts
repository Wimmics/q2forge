The application is a part of the IDSM project and allows SPARQL querying of PubChem data.
Data Schema
The database uses the data coming from the PubChemRDF project that provides RDF formatted information available in the PubChem archive. It mainly comprises information from the PubChem Compound, Substance, and Bioassay databases.

The PubChemRDF data includes many semantic relationships, for which existing ontologies are employed, whenever it is possible. Parts of these ontologies (e.g., class hierarchies, resource labels) are loaded into the database as well. Summarization of the used ontologies and relationship predicates are summarized in the PubChemRDF documentation.`

export const llm_generation_answer = "<think>\nOkay, so I need to generate two scientifically relevant questions based on the provided knowledge graph (KG). Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the description of the KG. It's part of the IDSM project and allows SPARQL querying of PubChem data. The database includes PubChem Compound, Substance, and Bioassay databases. It uses various ontologies to structure the data, including ChEBI, MESH, BAO, PRO, GO, etc. \n\nThe condensed schema representation lists a bunch of ontologies with their versions. This tells me that the KG is extensive, covering a wide range of biological and chemical domains, each with their own structured data.\n\nThe additional context mentions that PubChemRDF offers information in RDF format, organized into subdomains like compound, substance, bioassay, genes, proteins, pathways, etc. It also provides SPARQL queries and use cases, which suggests that the KG supports complex scientific inquiries.\n\nI need to create two questions. Each should be categorized by subtopic, with labels indicating their complexity (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced) and relevant tags. The questions should cover multiple scientific domains and vary in complexity.\n\nLet me think about the key subtopics. From the context, subdomains include compound, substance, bioassay, gene/protein, pathway, taxonomy, cell line, disease, etc.\n\nFor the first question, maybe something about compounds and their relationships. Since PubChemRDF includes compound and substance databases, a question linking compounds to their biological activities would make sense. That could involve the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) for the activities and maybe PRO for proteins.\n\nThe second question could focus on pathways and genes. Since there's a pathway subdomain and ontologies like Gene Ontology (GO) and BioPAX, this would fit well.\n\nNow, thinking about complexity:\n\n1. An intermediate question: How do compounds relate to their bioassay results and proteins? This requires knowledge of multiple ontologies and how they connect in the KG.\n2. An advanced question: How do specific pathways relate to diseases, genes, and their orthologs? This would require more complex querying, possibly involving multiple ontologies and relationships.\n\nI need to phrase these questions clearly, ensuring they are scientifically relevant and precise. They should each have appropriate tags from the available ontologies and relevant domains.\n\nSo, first question: \"What are the key relationships between chemical compounds and their associated bioassay results, and how do these relate to protein interactions in the PubChemRDF dataset?\"\n\nThis touches on compounds, substances, bioassays, and protein interactions, using ontologies like PubChemRDF, BAO, and PRO.\n\nSecond question: \"How can one identify biological pathways associated with specific diseases, and what genes and orthologs are involved in these pathways across different species in the PubChemRDF knowledge graph?\"\n\nThis involves pathways, diseases, genes, and orthologs, using ontologies like BioPAX, DO, GO, and OBI.\n\nI think these cover multiple domains and vary in complexity from intermediate to advanced. Let me make sure they are clear and precise.\n</think>\n\nHere are the two scientifically relevant questions generated based on the knowledge graph:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"question\": \"What are the key relationships between chemical compounds and their associated bioassay results, and how do these relate to protein interactions in the PubChemRDF dataset?\",\n    \"complexity\": \"Intermediate\",\n    \"tags\": [\"PubChemRDF\", \"BioAssay Ontology (BAO)\", \"Protein Ontology (PRO)\", \"Compound\", \"Substance\", \"Protein Interactions\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"question\": \"How can one identify biological pathways associated with specific diseases, and what genes and orthologs are involved in these pathways across different species in the PubChemRDF knowledge graph?\",\n    \"complexity\": \"Advanced\",\n    \"tags\": [\"PubChemRDF\", \"Biological Pathway\", \"Disease Ontology (DO)\", \"Gene Ontology (GO)\", \"Orthologs\", \"BioPAX\"]\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThese questions are designed to cover multiple scientific domains and vary in complexity from intermediate to advanced, incorporating relevant ontologies and subtopics from the provided knowledge graph."
